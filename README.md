# the-rotator

This project was on my CS 235 midterm. It is about rotating images about specific pivot points using direct manipulation techniques.

## Changelog

* v0.0.1 - updated logic in `mousePressed()`, `mouseReleased()`, and `mouseDragged()` methods in `ofApp.cpp` and added state variables in `ofApp.h` only.
